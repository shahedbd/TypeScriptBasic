At times, there might be a need to store a collection of values of varied types. 
Arrays will not serve this purpose. TypeScript gives us a data type called tuple 
that helps to achieve such a purpose.

It represents a heterogeneous collection of values. 
In other words, tuples enable storing multiple fields of different types. 
Tuples can also be passed as parameters to functions.
